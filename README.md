Interactive maps

This project uses the GeoPandas package to build a spatial analysis map. Then publish it on interactive leaflet.js maps. I was trying to focus on the relation between the COVID-19 confirmed case and spatial. The map selected towns which population density is over 5000 person per square kilometer
